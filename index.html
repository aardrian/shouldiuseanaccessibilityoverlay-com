<h2 class="heading" id="why"><a href="#why">Why Not?</a></h2>

<p>The consensus of many people with disabilities, the web design and development community, and legal voices in this space, are that accessibility overlays are not useful on a website for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They do not address inherent accessibility barriers. For example, missing alternative text, proper labeling, multimedia captioning and transcription, keyboard access, etc. An overlay cannot fix these things.</li>
  <li>Many disabled people already have the software that they require to navigate the web and can easily leverage features already built into their browsers and operating systems, so where is the value? Do you really think your website is the first one a disabled person has ever visited.</li>
  <li>You can still be sued. Many overlay companies take advantage of your lack of knowledge about accessibility and sell empty promises that will <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2020/06/accessibe-will-get-you-sued.html">not shield you from litigation</a>. Don't play the fool.</li>
  <li>They can make accessibility worse. So much so, that disabled users <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2020/06/accessibe-will-get-you-sued.html#Update12">actively block overlays</a>. This defeats the purpose of including an overlay to begin with.</li>
  <li>Privacy. People with disabilities have more at stake in protecting their anonymity online and want to avoid being singled out and treated differently (they get enough of that in real life), so the need to <a href="https://tink.uk/accessibe-and-data-protection/">protect ones privacy</a> is even more important.</li>
  <li>Performance. Do you really need more scripts and unnecessary features cluttering up your website? Many search engines <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/search-ads-speed">rank your site</a> by how performant they are. This won't help you achieve that.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="heading" id="solution"><a href="#solution">So what should I do to make my website accessible?</a></h2>

<p><strong>The answer is simple:</strong> People who are disabled want to be treated <em>equally</em>, so they expect you to design and build your website with inclusion and accessibility in mind and not to throw a band-aid on it. The only way to do that is to commit, provision for, and make accessibility a part of your process <em>throughout the lifetime of your website</em>.</p>

<h2 class="heading" id="excuses"><a href="#excuses">But accessibility is too hard and expensive.</a></h2>

<p>So is design, development, testing, security, and proper management and maintenance of your website, but we have come to accept that those things are important and worth our time. Why should accessibility be treated any differently? Not only is it the right thing to do, but there is a <a href="https://www.deque.com/blog/the-business-case-for-accessibility/">strong business case</a> to make your website more accessible, too.</p>

<h2 class="heading" id="overlays-bad"><a href="#overlays-bad">Are all overlays bad?</a></h2>

<p>Pretty much, but there may be some occasions when an overlay can be used. For example, using one as a <em>temporary</em> solution while accessibility remediation is underway. <a href="https://overlayfactsheet.com/">Overlay Fact Sheet</a> takes an in-depth look at the <a href="https://overlayfactsheet.com/#strengths-and-weaknesses-of-overlay-widgets">strengths and weaknesses of overlay widgets</a>, that you should definitely check out.</p>
